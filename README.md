# Arducopter-Sitl-UnrealEngine
Create a binding between the arducopter sitl simulation and the unreal engine

Downloading the Arducopter environment:

* Download the arducopter code from [github](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/ArduCopter)
* Or you can do:
> https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git

 * Then you need to checkout the version that we know the simulation works (may work with other higher version)
> git checkout Copter-3.3-rc5


Installation:
Unreal engine :
Download link 
* [Windows/Mac](https://www.unrealengine.com/).
* [Linux](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine)

Linux : [Tutorial](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Building_On_Linux)
```
./UnrealEngine-4.11/Setup.sh
./UnrealEngine-4.11/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/GenerateProjectFiles.sh
cd ./UnrealEngine-4.11/
make
```
Using python packages :
pymavlink - for the simulation
utm - for the conversion of geo to utm

> sudo apt-get install python-pip
> sudo pip install utm

Running the Unreal-Engine  :
> ~/UnrealEngine/Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor

Building the project source outside the Unreal engine to figure out what the problem is:
> ~/UnrealEngine/Engine/Binaries/DotNET$ mono UnrealBuildTool.exe FPSProject Linux Debug -project="\"/home/ohadanny/Documents/Unreal Projects/FPSProject/FPSProject.uproject\""


Running the arducopter sitl with the communication to the unreal-project:
> ./run_sim

Kill simulation:
> ./run_sim kill

In order to make the run_sim work you will need to install screen
> sudo apt-get install screen



In order for the simulation to run you need to overlook all the failsafes and such:
in the mavproxy screen run :
arm uncheck all

simulation:
* ch1 - roll
* ch2 - pitch
* ch3 - throttle
* ch4 - yaw
