# Arducopter-Sitl-UnrealEngine
Create a binding between the arducopter sitl simulation and the unreal engine


Installation:
Unreal engine :
Download link 
* [Windows/Mac](https://www.unrealengine.com/).
* [Linux](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine)



Using python packages :
pymavlink - for the simulation
utm - for the conversion of geo to utm

Running the Unreal-Engine  :
> ~/UnrealEngine/Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor

Building the project source outside the Unreal engine to figure out what the problem is:
> ~/UnrealEngine/Engine/Binaries/DotNET$ mono UnrealBuildTool.exe FPSProject Linux Debug -project="\"/home/ohadanny/Documents/Unreal Projects/FPSProject/FPSProject.uproject\""


Running the arducopter sitl with the communication to the unreal-project:
> ./run_sim

Kill simulation:
> ./run_sim kill

In order for the simulation to run you need to overlook all the failsafes and such:
in the mavproxy screen run :
arm uncheck all

simulation:
* ch1 - roll
* ch2 - pitch
* ch3 - throttle
* ch4 - yaw
